# Copilot Demos for Java developers

![Java Icon with IntelliJ](./images/icon_java.jpg)

This contains a collection of demos for Copilot for Java programming language. This is going to be useful for customers who are interested in using Java development with Copilot.

For Java customers, they are likely to use Ecllipse IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, or even variations of Eclipse like Spring Framework IDE more than Visual Studio Code. Unfortunately, Copilot is not available for Eclipse IDE or its variations. However, you can show IntellI IDEA demos to Java customers or simple Java demos to show how Copilot works in Visual Studio Code.

> GitHub Copilot is only available for VS Code, Visual Studio IDE, NeoVim, and IntelliJ and GitHub Copilot is not available for Jupyter Notebooks.

## Prerequisites

Some of these demos can be done with just VS Code, but some advanced demoes are better done using IntelliJ IDEA. 

- [VS Code for some demo](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [IntellI IDEA for some demo](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [GitHub Copilot Extension for IntellJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot) or [VS Code Extension for Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
